1. Create a git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it. (it will save csv file to new folder "data").
3. Do git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.(make sure you have put data folder in .gitignore as we will be tracking data folder via DVC)
4. pip install dvc # if not installed already.
5. Now do 'dvc init' to initialize DVC. It will create .dvcignore and .dvc.
6. Do 'mkdir S3' and treat it as your remote S3 location
7. Now do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3".
8. Next "dvc add data/".
9. Then "git add .gitignore data.dvc .dvc/config". then "git commit-push"
10. Now "dvc commit" and "dvc push" this will push data to remote destinaton in our case it is S3 folder.
11. Now "git add-commit-push" to mark this stage as first version of data.
12. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status".
13. Then "dvc commit" and "dvc push"
14. Then "git add-commit-push" (we are saving v2 of our data at this point).
15. To roll out to previous version of data do "git checkout " to commit has of 'first version of data' and then "do dvc pull"
